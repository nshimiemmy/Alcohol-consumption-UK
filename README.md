# Alcohol-consumption-UK
Alcohol consumption is becoming increasingly common in the UK, leading to negative consequences. Heavy drinking can cause harmful health effects in the short and long term, including liver disease, stroke, and some cancers. It's important to note that the impacts of alcohol aren't limited to physical health; they can also affect mental health and lead to death.

Researchers have conducted numerous studies to highlight this problem. I'm interested in presenting some insights using data collected from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)â€”UK to analyze alcohol-related deaths in the UK, but I will emphasise England.
