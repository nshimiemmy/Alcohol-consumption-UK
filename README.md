# Alcohol-consumption-UK
Alcohol consumption is becoming increasingly common in the UK, leading to negative consequences. Heavy drinking can cause harmful health effects in the short and long term, including liver disease, stroke, and some cancers. It's important to note that the impacts of alcohol aren't limited to physical health; they can also affect mental health and lead to death.

Researchers have conducted numerous studies to highlight this problem. I'm interested in presenting some insights using data collected from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)â€”UK to analyze alcohol-related deaths in the UK, but I will emphasise England.

# Dataset

As part of this study, I am using a dataset published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - UK in March 2023. This dataset covers the period from 2001 to 2021 and contains information about alcohol-related deaths in the United Kingdom, including England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The data is classified according to various parameters such as sex, age groups, and specific causes of death related to alcohol.

My focus will be on England, and I will be analyzing data to gain valuable insights into the trends and patterns of alcohol-related mortality over the past 20 years, from 2001. This analysis can help to better understand the public health implications of alcohol consumption.

As part of this study, I will be utilising artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms.

The dataset contains separate datasets for each country in the UK. I have separated the England dataset.
